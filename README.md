# week-1-code-refactor-challenge

This project is a code refactor to support a marketing agency website. The website contains information about search engine optimisation, online reputation management, social media marketing, lead generation,Â brand awareness, and cost management.

The website contains different semantic HTML elements, such as header, navigation, sections, articles, and footer elements. In this code revision, I updated the websites title, fixed a link and also changed the div tags to HTML semantic tags for easier understanding of the code, which I styled the website by using CSS.

To modernise the code, it is essential to refactor it. Because this gives the website a clear structure and fewer repetitive div tags thanks to the use of semantic HTML elements, the code is much simpler to read, comprehend, and organise. As a result, this will make the website maintenance much simpler.

In conclusion, the code restructuring assisted me in learning:
. Updating a website and making it more accessible and easier to understand.
. HTML semantic attributes
. The deployments, commits, and repos on Github
. Writing a read me file.
